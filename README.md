# 🚀 Advanced Disk Scheduling Simulator

## 📌 Overview
The **Advanced Disk Scheduling Simulator** is a powerful tool designed to **visualize and analyze** various disk scheduling algorithms. It helps users understand the **efficiency** and **working principles** of different scheduling techniques used in operating systems.

---

## ✨ Features
✅ Supports multiple disk scheduling algorithms:
- 🟢 **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
- 🔵 **Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)**
- 🔴 **SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)**
- 🟡 **C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)**
- 🟣 **LOOK**
- 🟠 **C-LOOK (Circular LOOK)**

✅ **Interactive visualization** of disk arm movements
✅ **Performance analysis** (seek time & total head movements)
✅ **User-friendly** interface with real-time input processing
✅ **Graphical representation** of scheduling sequences
